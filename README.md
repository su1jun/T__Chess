## 📢QnA
### 1. What is the stockfish?
![stockfish](https://github.com/su1jun/Chess/assets/120762843/395fe0ed-f985-4eda-a321-3c9277eb7ee3)  
**Stockfish** is an **open-source chess engine**.  
As the Stockfish team focuses solely on developing the chess engine,  
integrating it with a suitable GUI program and protocol is essential for gameplay or analysis.   
  
**- Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm**:  
Stockfish employs an alpha-beta pruning algorithm to efficiently reduce the number of nodes evaluated  
in the minimax decision tree, optimizing search for the best move.  

**- Evaluation Function**:  
The engine uses a sophisticated evaluation function considering factors like piece value,  
pawn structure, mobility, king safety, and control of the board center, each weighted by its strategic importance.  

**- Deep and Fast Search**:  
Stockfish is renowned for its ability to deeply analyze a vast array of potential moves rapidly,  
making it ideal for both extended and rapid-play chess games.   
    
    
### 2. Do I need a Python program or package?
No, if the exe file works fine, that's all you need.  
However, in cases like a Mac environment or unknown errors, Python and the pygame library are required.  
The program was developed in `Python v3.11`, `Pygame v2.5.2`.  
If your environment is set up,  
you can run the Chess program by executing the command `python src/main.py` in the Chess folder directory  

### 3. I can't execute the exe file...
Firstly, it should be a Windows environment.  

The file `Chess.exe` and the package `build/main/main.pkg` are large files over 100MB,  
so you need Git Large File Storage (LFS) to download them.  
You will need to download LFS and use the clone command for a proper download.  
For more details, visit:  
- [Git LFS - Official Site / Download](https://git-lfs.com/)  
- [Git LFS - Reference](https://fakecan.tistory.com/90)  

### 4. What is the console window that pops up when running the game?  
It's a process window for the artificial intelligence. It doesn't cause any harm to your computer.  

### 5. Can I beat the computer?
Yes, but it's more likely at lower levels.
